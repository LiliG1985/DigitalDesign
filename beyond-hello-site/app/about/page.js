            <p>
              Every business has a first hello: the moment someone lands on your site and
              decides, in about three seconds, whether to stay. That moment is too important to
              leave to a generic template, and it's the whole reason Beyond Hello exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most businesses today, a website <em>is</em> that first hello. It's the
              impression a customer forms before they ever speak to you, and it quietly decides
              whether they stay or click away. We build sites that carry that hello further,
              into a call booked, a sale made, a client won.
            </p>
            <p>
              We work with founders and small teams worldwide, remotely, on fixed-price
              packages, so you know exactly what you're getting before you book, and can go
              from an idea to a live site in a matter of weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond Hello is based in Dubai, but the work isn't limited to it: clients come from
              across the UAE and from around the world, all handled remotely. The name is the
              point. A hello is where a relationship with a customer starts, not where it ends,
              and a site that only manages the hello and nothing after it is doing half its job.
