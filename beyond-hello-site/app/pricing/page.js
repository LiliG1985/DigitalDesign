const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does the deposit work?",
    a: "You pay a deposit at booking to secure your build slot on the calendar. The remaining balance is invoiced once the site is ready to launch, so you're never charged the full amount upfront.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why not just buy a template for less?",
    a: "You can, and plenty of businesses do. A template is fast and cheap because someone else already made every decision for you: the layout, the pacing, the way it makes a visitor feel. A custom build costs more because those decisions get made around your business specifically. If a template is doing the job, keep it. If it's starting to feel like everyone else's site, that's usually the moment to switch.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my project doesn't fit a package?",
    a: "Book a free scoping call from the Custom package. We'll talk through what you need and send a fixed quote before anything is charged.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with clients outside your timezone?",
    a: "Yes. This is a remote, Dubai-based studio working with clients worldwide: calls are scheduled around your timezone, and updates happen asynchronously in between.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do you need from me to get started?",
    a: "Your logo and brand assets if you have them, any copy or content you want included, and a few examples of sites you like. If you don't have all of that yet, that's normal. We'll figure it out together on the kickoff call.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a Care plan?",
    a: "No, every site launches in working order without one. A Care plan just covers what happens after: keeping software updated, backups running, and small edits handled without you needing to open a ticket somewhere else.",
