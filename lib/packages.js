// Central source of truth for packages, used by the pricing page,
// the booking form, and the checkout API route.
//
// Pricing sits just above the entry-level floor of the 2026 Dubai web design
// market: freelance/small-studio baselines start around AED 2,900 (basic),
// AED 5,900 (mid-tier custom), and AED 9,500+ (e-commerce/custom app), and
// the market runs several times higher than that at the agency end.
// Deliberately priced competitive rather than rock-bottom, so it reads as a
// fair, confident price rather than the cheapest option on the page.
// All prices are quoted in AED; the studio is Dubai-based.
